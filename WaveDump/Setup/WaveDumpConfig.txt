# TEST_PATTERN: if enabled, data from ADC are replaced by test pattern (triangular wave)
# options: YES, NO
TEST_PATTERN   NO

# ENABLE_DES_MODE: double edge sampling mode for the models 731 and 751. If enabled, the
# board interleaves two channels to make one channel running at double sampling frequency.
# This setting is ignored for the boards that don't support DES mode.
# options: YES, NO
ENABLE_DES_MODE  NO

# EXTERNAL_TRIGGER: external trigger input settings. When enabled, the ext. trg. can be either 
# propagated (ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT) or not (ACQUISITION_ONLY) through the TRGOUT
# options: DISABLED, ACQUISITION_ONLY, ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT
EXTERNAL_TRIGGER   ACQUISITION_ONLY

# FAST_TRIGGER: fast trigger input settings. ONLY FOR 742 MODELS. When enabled, the fast trigger is used for the data acquisition 
# options: DISABLED, ACQUISITION_ONLY
FAST_TRIGGER   ACQUISITION_ONLY	
#FAST_TRIGGER   DISABLED	

# FAST_TRIGGER_DIGITIZING: ONLY FOR 742 MODELS. If enabled the fast trigger signal is digitized and it is present in data readout as channel n.8 for each group.
# options: YES, NO
ENABLED_FAST_TRIGGER_DIGITIZING		YES		
#ENABLED_FAST_TRIGGER_DIGITIZING		NO	

# MAX_NUM_EVENTS_BLT: maximum number of events to read out in one Block Transfer. High values corresponds to 
# options: 1 to 1023
MAX_NUM_EVENTS_BLT   1

# POST_TRIGGER: post trigger size in percent of the whole acquisition window
# options: 0 to 100
# On models 742 there is a delay of about 35nsec on signal Fast Trigger TR; the post trigger is added to this delay  
POST_TRIGGER  20

# TRIGGER_EDGE: decides whether the trigger occurs on the rising or falling edge of the signal
# options: RISING, FALLING
TRIGGER_EDGE  FALLING

# USE_INTERRUPT: number of events that must be ready for the readout when the IRQ is asserted.
# Zero means that the interrupts are not used (readout runs continuously)
USE_INTERRUPT 0

# FPIO_LEVEL: type of the front panel I/O LEMO connectors 
# options: NIM, TTL
FPIO_LEVEL  NIM

# WRITE_REGISTER: generic write register access. This command allows the user to have a direct write access to the
# registers of the board. NOTE: all the direct write accesses are executed before the other setting, thus it might
# happen that one specific setting overwrites the register content.
# Syntax: WRITE_REGISTER ADDRESS DATA, where ADDRESS is the address offset of the register (16 bit hex)
# and DATA is the value being written (31 bit hex)
# Example: WRITE_REGISTER  1080  00000010  # Set the threshold of channel 0 to 16 ADC counts (hex 10)
#  WRITE_REGISTER  8168  8  


# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Individual Settings 
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# The following setting are usually applied on channel by channel
# basis; however, you can put them also in the [COMMON] section in
# order to apply them to all the channels.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# ENABLE_INPUT: enable/disable one channel (or one group in the case of the Mod 740 and Mod 742)
# options: YES, NO
ENABLE_INPUT          NO

# DC_OFFSET: DC offset adjust (DAC channel setting) in percent of the Full Scale. 
# For model 740 and 742* the DC offset adjust is the same for all channel in the group
# -50: analog input dynamic range = -Vpp to 0 (negative signals)*
# +50: analog input dynamic range = 0 to +Vpp (positive signals)*
# 0:   analog input dynamic range = -Vpp/2 to +Vpp/2 (bipolar signals)*
# options: -50.0 to 50.0  (floating point)
#*NOTE: Ranges are different for 742 Model.....see GRP_CH_DC_OFFSET description
DC_OFFSET              0

# GRP_CH_DC_OFFSET dc_0, dc_1, dc_2, dc_3, dc_4, dc_5, dc_6, dc_7
# Available only for model 742, allows to set different DC offset adjust for each channel (DAC channel setting) in percent of the Full Scale. 
# -50: analog input dynamic range = -3Vpp/2 to -Vpp/2 (max negative dynamic)
# +50: analog input dynamic range = +Vpp/2 to +3Vpp/2 (max positive dynamic)
# 0: analog input dynamic range = -Vpp/2 to +Vpp/2 (bipolar signals)
# options: -50.0 to 50.0  (floating point)

# TRIGGER_THRESHOLD: threshold for the channel auto trigger (ADC counts)
# options 0 to 2^N-1 (N=Number of bit of the ADC)
TRIGGER_THRESHOLD      100

# CHANNEL_TRIGGER: channel auto trigger settings. When enabled, the ch. auto trg. can be either 
# propagated (ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT) or not (ACQUISITION_ONLY) through the TRGOUT
# options: DISABLED, ACQUISITION_ONLY, ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT
CHANNEL_TRIGGER        DISABLED

# GROUP_TRG_ENABLE_MASK: this option is used only for the Models x740. These models have the
# channels grouped 8 by 8; one group of 8 channels has a common trigger that is generated as
# the OR of the self trigger of the channels in the group that are enabled by this mask.
# options: 0 to FF
